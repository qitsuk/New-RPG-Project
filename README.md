# Java Assignment 1 - RPG Characters
Building a simple console app in Java

## Description
In this assingment we are tasked with creating a simple console app, that can create, level up and place equipment - weapons and armors - upon a RPG character.

## Getting started

#### Using an IDE:

Clone the project to your desired location, and open the project folder with your favourite Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse, and so forth...)

### Dependencies
JDK 17 (I've used OpenJDK, but any JDK of your choosing should do perfectly fine.)

Build the project and run Main.java, CharacterTest.java and EquimentTests.java from your IDE.

### Executable

There is currently not enough functionality to create an executable from this project.
